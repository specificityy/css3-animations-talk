# Demystifying CSS3 Animations

This is a presentation I made on <a target='_blank' href='http://CorkDev.io'>CorkDev.io</a> (<a target='_blank' href='http://www.meetup.com/corkdev-io/events/220966368/'>Meetup</a>) about CSS3 Animations.

There are two ways to run it:

1.	Just open `presentation.html` 

2.	Or go on the command line and start the node server: `node app.js`

Then go to `localhost:3000`

At any moment you can press letter **S** to open the speaker view and take a look at the notes.
