# Demystifying CSS3 Animations

This is a presentation I made on <a target='_blank' href='http://CorkDev.io'>CorkDev.io</a> (<a target='_blank' href='http://www.meetup.com/corkdev-io/events/220966368/'>Meetup</a>) about CSS3 Animations.

Here's the <a target=_blank' href='https://twitter.com/pinkkis/status/585443676337414144?t=1&cn=bWVudGlvbg%3D%3D&sig=fdab8deb5995afc8aa029ae680d3eae4cee60efd&al=1&refsrc=email&iid=5c75875385f1452180921a9c51e838e0&autoactions=1428415624&uid=1940326022&nid=4+1264'>video</a>, we didn't have the best projector that day.. or a taller table for me to place the laptop ^_^ but we were able to carry through.

There are two ways to run the slides:

1.	Just open `presentation.html` 

2.	Or go on the command line and start the node server: `node app.js` then go to `localhost:3000`

At any moment you can press the letter **S** to open the speaker view and take a look at the notes.

It was made using the HTML presentations framework <a target='_blank' href='http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/'>Reveal.js</a>
